===================Error_Handling.txt===================
# Contains a list of errors that are addressed by the
# submission or has a suitable strategy that has been
# suggested to handle them.

---Possible Errors: ---
1: -if file was not listed on command line

2: -if the file does not exist when grabbing from command line

3: -if one of the formatting parameters is not what it should be

===other errors:
4: -what if the file is too large for the memory to handle?

5: -what if the file contains special characters such as a copywrite symbol
	or some other form of non-standard character

6: -if we weren't using python, what if the line was too large than what
	we were expecting?

7: -if the input to the Formatter class is not what it should be

---Fixes for Errors: ---
1: -read from stdin

2: -print error for IOError saying that file DNE

3: -prints the parameter as normal text assuming it is part of the file

4: -would have to break it into chunks and evaluate and print each piece at
	a time assuming the ability to use dynamic memory allocation

5: -would have to use some other character encoding when reading the lines
	from the file so that the printout would be correct

6: -would have to use dynamic memory allocation to account for the
	oversized line

7: -need to do a check on the input line in the formatter class to ensure
	that the input is what is desired, else quit and throw an error
