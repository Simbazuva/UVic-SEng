Heapsort independent of heap:
	A=Array
	P=Priority Queue
	insert every element of A into P
	removeMin n times to extract sorted dequence
	
	Queue Type 	| 	insert 		| 	removemin	|	Sort
	Unsorted Array		O(1)			O(n)			O(n^2)		
	Sorted Array		O(n)			O(1)			O(n^2)
	Heap			O(logn)			O(logn)			O(nlogn)
	"Magic Box"		O(loglogn)		O(loglogn)		O(nloglogn)
	
	because nloglogn is strictly smaller than nlogn
	a comparison sorting algorithm MUST take nlogn
	


Master Theorem stuff:
	T(n)=aT(n/b) + f(n)
	    =a^logb(n) * T(1) + SUM(f(n/1)
	    = n^logb(a) * T(1) + SUM(f(n/1)
