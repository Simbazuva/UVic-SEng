/* Data Types */
ADT:
	no concrete information or any details about it but it is an idea
	some exaples are lists, queues, trees, etc...
	Might talk about what the things mean but don't put in any info.
	
Data Structure:
	An exact definition of the method names and details of the structure.
	Need to know all of the details, it is implemented in a concrete way.
	
Instance vs. Static:
	Instance:
		Associated with a particular instance of an object.
		In order to invoke an instance method, you have to have an
		instance of an object.
		ex: Student s = new Student("Jason");
		Then s.getName(); where the "s" is the instance which references
		the student with the name "Jason".
	Static:
		Removed the need to instantiate objects because there is only
		one of the method that exists. such as: int x = fib(7); where
		fib is a static method.
