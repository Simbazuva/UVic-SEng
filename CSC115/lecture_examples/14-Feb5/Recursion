/* ----- Recursion ----- */

// A recursive method is one that calls itself.
// In order for a problem to be solved recursively:
	1- There mist be at ;east pne base case
		- A part of the problem solved without recursion
	2- each recursive call must make progress towards the base case
	3- believe it works
