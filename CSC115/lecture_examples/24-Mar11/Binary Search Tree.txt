/* Binary Search Tree */

=> Insert
=> Find
=> Traverals
=> for all nodes n in a binary search tree:
	-the value at n must be:
		greater than all nodes in the right subtree
		-and-
		less than all nodes in the left subtree
=>expected case is LogN Note: NO O()!
	worst case is O(N)

	
	
	
class Node{
	int element;

	Node left;
	Node right;
} // must understand how it is implemented!
  // kinda like a doubly linked list that are referenced to the left and right elements
