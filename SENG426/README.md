# SENG426

There was a programming aspect to this class.  The program was so insecure and broken that I debated removing it entirely.  I included it as the e-Chequeing_project as an example of what could be in store for someone taking this class.  Testing and coverage reports were to be made for the program but they were done in a very terrible way.  Painful time, do not recommend.
