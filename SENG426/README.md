# SENG426

There was a programming aspect to this class.  The program was so insecure and broken that I decided to remove it.  It was not working the data storage to keep around.  Testing and coverage reports were to be made for the program but they were done in a very terrible way.  Painful time, do not recommend.  The program was a e-transfer system with no security.
